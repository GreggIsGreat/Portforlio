            Engines have pistons that move up and down inside metal tubes
            called cylinders. Imagine riding a bicycle: Your legs move
            up and down to turn the pedals. Pistons are connected via rods
            (they're like your shins) to a crankshaft, and they move up and
            down to spin the engine's crankshaft, the same way your legs
            spin the bike'sâ€”which in turn powers the bike's drive wheel
            or car's drive wheels. Depending on the vehicle, there are
            typically between two and 12 cylinders in its engine,
            with a piston moving up and down in each.
